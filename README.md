### Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
About Me:<br><br>👋 Hello! Thanks for visiting my profile. <br><br>🌱 I started my journey as a junior frontend developer around 7 months ago and have been passionate about coding ever since. My current focus is on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm actively learning and exploring React.<br><br>💻 In my daily work, I leverage Git, GitHub, and GitLab for version control and collaborate with teams using various tools and technologies like Gulp and jQuery and also using the BEM Methodology.<br><br>🚀 I'm excited to grow as a developer and keen to contribute to innovative projects. I'm actively seeking opportunities with companies that value dedicated and motivated individuals like me.<br><br>🎯 Aside from my coding experience, I bring over 7 years of expertise in the HR field. For the past 3 years, I've held the role of Head of Human Resources & Sales Manager in an employee agency, where I've honed my leadership and interpersonal skills.<br><br>📫 Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, suggestions, or opportunities for collaboration. I'm always open to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring new challenges.<br><br>
